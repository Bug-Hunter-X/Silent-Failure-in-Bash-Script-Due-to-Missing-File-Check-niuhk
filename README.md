# Silent Failure in Bash Script Due to Missing File Check

This repository demonstrates a common error in bash scripting: silent failure due to insufficient error handling.  The script attempts to process a file, but it fails silently if the file does not exist or is not readable.  The solution demonstrates how to properly handle these error conditions.

## Bug
The `bug.sh` script attempts to process a file using `cat` and `awk`. If the file does not exist or is not accessible, `cat` will fail silently and the script will not produce an error message, potentially leading to unexpected results or difficult-to-debug issues.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.sh` script addresses the issue by explicitly checking for the file's existence and readability before attempting to process it. It uses informative error messages to guide debugging and improve maintainability.
